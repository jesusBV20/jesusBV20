Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm JesÃºs Bautista Villar, a PhD. Student at [Swarm Systems Lab](https://www.swarmsystemslab.eu/). 

Although my bachelor's degree was in physics, my current focus is on swarm robotics and autonomous systems. In my research, I enjoy joining together control theory with the world of physics. At the Swarm Systems Lab, we consistently adopt this approach, aiming to gain a physical understanding of our control systems and explore potential emergent behaviors that arise from the disparities between some mathematical results and the real world. 

If you want to know more about me and my scientific work, check out [my research web](https://sites.google.com/view/jbautista-research/inicio)ðŸ¤–.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for any collaboration or discussions!
